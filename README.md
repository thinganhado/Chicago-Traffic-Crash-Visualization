# Chicago Traffic Crash Visualization Project

This data visualization project explores traffic crash data from the City of Chicago to uncover contributing factors, spatial-temporal patterns, and crash severity outcomes. The dashboard is built using Tableau, with data cleaning performed in Python.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project aims to:
- Identify the leading causes of traffic accidents.
- Explore spatio-temporal patterns in crash distribution and police response times.
- Analyze the impact of crashes in terms of vehicle damage and injury severity.

## Files Included
- `dashboard/Chicago Traffic Crash Analysis.pdf` â€“ Tableau dashboard file.
- `data_cleaning/traffic_crash_dataset_datacleaning.ipynb` â€“ Python notebook for preprocessing.
- `reports/` â€“ Contains proposal, final report, and visualisation critiques.

## Dataset
**Source:** [Chicago Traffic Crashes - Crashes](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if/about_data)

Used in combination with:
- Traffic Crashes - People
- Traffic Crashes - Vehicles

## Tools Used
- **Python** (for data cleaning)
- **Tableau** (for interactive visualization)
- **Pandas, NumPy** (in preprocessing)

## Key Findings
- Driver behavior (e.g., failing to yield, speeding) is the top contributing factor to accidents.
- Most crashes occur during daylight and dry conditions, suggesting human error over environmental factors.
- High-crash zones correspond with areas of limited traffic control infrastructure.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data wrangling and feature engineering
- Multi-layered dashboard design using Tableau
- Effective use of filters, tooltips, and layout organization
- Visualization critique using Edward Tufteâ€™s and Gestalt principles
